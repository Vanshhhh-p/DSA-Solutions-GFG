# Remove Duplicates in Sorted Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Given the head of a sorted singly linked list, remove all duplicate nodes so that each element appears only once. The resulting linked list should remain sorted.

 **Note:**  Try to solve the problem without using extra space.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: Head: 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5
Output: 2 -> 4 -> 5

Explanation: In the given linked list 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, only 2 occurs more than 1 time. So we need to remove it once.

```

```
Input: Head: 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2
Output: 2

Explanation: In the given linked list  2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2, 2 is the only element and is repeated 5 times. So we need to remove any four 2.
```

```java
/* Structure of linked list Node
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int d) {
      data = d;
      next = null;
    }
}
*/
class Solution {
    Node removeDuplicates(Node head) {
        Node prev = head;
        Node curr = head.next;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            if (prev.data != curr.data) {
                prev = prev.next;
                curr= curr.next;
            }
            else {
                prev.next = curr.next;
                curr = curr.next;
            }
        }
        return head;
    }
}
```
