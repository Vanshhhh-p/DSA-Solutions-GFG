# Detect Loop in Linked List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given a singly linked list, find if the given linked list contains a **loop or not**. A loop exists in a linked list if the next pointer of the last node points to any other node in the list (including itself), rather than being null.

 **Note:** Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: pos = 2,
   
Output: true
Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the second node.

```

```
Input: pos = 0,
   
Output: false
Explanation: There exists no loop in given linked list.

```

```
Input: pos = 1,
   
Output: true
Explanation: There exists a loop as last node is connected back to the first node.
```

```java
/* Linked List Node Structure
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = null;
    }
}
*/

class Solution {
    public boolean detectLoop(Node head) {
        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head;
        
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
            
            if (fast == slow) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
